    <h3>Cake:</h3>

        <br>4.Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes.
        
        <br>5.Meanwhile for lemon drizzle topping whisk sugar and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth.
